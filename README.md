## Data-Structures

### 1. [Train Station](Train-Station/README.md)

Creates a log for a train station for:

- Opereting trains.
- Finding useful information about those trains.
- Organazing them in the most efficient way.
This project utilizes one way linked lists that take the form of the trains and store the information.

### 2. [Vigenère Chiper](Vigenère-Chiper/README.md)

Multi-dicitonary based on AVL tree in combination with Double-Linked-Lists.
