### [Train Station](./data-structures/Train-Station)

Creates a log for a train station for:

- Opereting trains.
- Finding useful information about those trains.
- Organazing them in the most efficient way.
This project utilizes one way linked lists that take the form of the trains and store the information.

### [Vigenère Chiper](./data-structures/Vigenère-Chiper)

Multi-dictionary based on AVL tree in combination with Double-Linked-Lists.
It manages a large database using an binary tree proprieties for efficient searching and balanced storage, and linked lists for dynamic data management.

### [Phantom Ghostdag](./data-structures/Phantom-Ghostdag)

A program that constructs a phantom GHOSTDAG using graph data structures to model and analyze the relationships between blocks in a blockchain network.

- [Polynomial Reduction](#polynomial-reduction)

### [Comparison-of-Hash-tables-and-Red-Blacks-Trees](Comparison-of-Hash-tables-and-Red-Blacks-Trees)

Comparing the performance of hash tables and red-black trees in terms of time and space complexity for storing and retrieving data in various use cases."

### [Polynomial Reduction](Polynomial-Reduction)

A program that solves computationally hard problems by reducing them to simpler ones using polynomial reduction techniques, to improve efficiency and scalability of the solution.
