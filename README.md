### [Train Station](./data-structures/Train-Station)

Creates a log for a train station for:

- Opereting trains.
- Finding useful information about those trains.
- Organazing them in the most efficient way.
This project utilizes one way linked lists that take the form of the trains and store the information.

### [Vigenère Chiper](./data-structures/Vigenère-Chiper)

Multi-dicitonary based on AVL tree in combination with Double-Linked-Lists.

### [Phantom Ghostdag](./data-structures/Phantom-Ghostdag)
