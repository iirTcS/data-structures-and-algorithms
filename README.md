# Data-Structures and Algorithms
## 1. Project1: **Train Station**
Creates a log for a train station for:
- Opereting trains.
- Finding useful information about those trains.
- Organazing them in the most efficient way.
This project utilizes one way linked lists that take the form of the trains and store the information.
## 2. Project2: **Vigen√®re Chiper**
Multi-dicitonary based on AVL tree in combination with Double-Linked-Lists.
